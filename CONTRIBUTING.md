# How to Collaborate in the Byte Benders Repository ü§ùüíª

Collaborating effectively is key to the success of our projects. Follow these steps to join in and contribute to the repository:

---

## 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

## 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using HTTPS:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Byte-Benders.git
```

```

*Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.*

---

## 3. Set Upstream Remote

Navigate into your cloned repository directory:

```bash

cd Byte-Benders

```

Add the original repository as the upstream remote to keep your fork up-to-date:

```bash

git remote add upstream https://github.com/daniel-ndeto/Byte-Benders.git
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash

git remote -v
```
You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the original repository).

---

## 4. Create a New Branch

Before making changes, create a new branch:

```bash

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
*Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your feature.*

---

## 5. Make Changes and Commit

Make your desired changes to the codebase. After making changes, stage and commit them:

```bash

git add .
git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message"
```

---

## 6. Push Changes to Your Fork

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash

git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 7. Keep Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the original repository:

```bash

git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## 8. Create a Pull Request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub, switch to your feature branch, and click on **"Compare & pull request"**. Provide a clear description of your changes and submit the pull request.

---

## 9. Participate in Code Review

Engage in the discussion on your pull request. Be open to feedback and make necessary changes by pushing additional commits to your feature branch.
